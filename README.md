# Frequencymeter-Design-with-Microcontroller

A frequencymeter circuit was designed using the AT89C52 microcontroller from the MCS-51 Family.

•LCD display.
•Measures the frequency of signals up to 100kHz.
•The amplitude of the periodic electrical signal whose frequency is to be measured is 5V at most.
•Regardless of the waveform (sine, triangle, sawtooth, etc.) of the periodic electrical signal whose frequency is to be measured, the frequency is measured.
•The clock frequency of the microcontroller system is 12MHz.
•The written program should be compiled and simulated with the Keil-C51 Compiler.
•The drawing and simulation of the frequencymeter designed using the PROTEUS program has been made.
