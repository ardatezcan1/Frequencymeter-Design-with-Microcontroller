# Frequencymeter-Design-with-Microcontroller

A frequencymeter circuit was designed using the AT89C52 microcontroller from the MCS-51 Family.

• LCD display.

• Measures the frequency of signals up to 100kHz.

• The amplitude of the periodic electrical signal whose frequency is to be measured is 5V at most.

• Regardless of the waveform (sine, triangle, sawtooth, etc.) of the periodic electrical signal whose frequency is to be measured, the frequency is measured.

• The clock frequency of the microcontroller system is 12MHz.

• The written program should be compiled and simulated with the Keil-C51 Compiler.

• The drawing and simulation of the frequencymeter designed using the PROTEUS program has been made.
